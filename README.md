This is a simple mod project to turn the CM storm mechanical switch tester into a functional keypad. 
There are 2 different programs for the keypad. 

Mech_kb:
The keypad will function as a basic macro launcher with macros for launching Facebook, and YouTube(through Firefox) and Spotify, Task manager, Mail, and Executor(http://executor.dk/). 

Mech_midi:
The keypad will function as a 6-note midi keyboard(Akebono scale). 

Mech_keypad:
The keypad will function as a navigation keypad with arrow keys, Page up and Page down.
